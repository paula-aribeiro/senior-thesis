It describes how dilatometric data are interpreted, with an emphasis on continuous heating and cooling transformation diagrams. These diagrams show the microstructural constituents that result from given heating and cooling conditions, and are an invaluable tool for the metallurgist in characterizing steels with respect to their response to heat treatments. Several practical examples and applications of dilatometry in steel research are briefly described in this work. {\textcopyright}2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Belisle2015,
abstract = {A knowledge of the physical properties of materials as a function of temperature, composition, applied external stresses, etc. is an important consideration in materials and process design. For new systems, such properties may be unknown and hard to measure or estimate from numerical simulations such as molecular dynamics. Engineers rely on machine learning to employ existing data in order to predict properties for new systems. Several techniques are currently used for such purposes. These include neural network, polynomial interpolation and Gaussian processes as well as the more recent dynamic trees and scalable Gaussian processes. In this paper we compare these approaches for three sets of materials sciences data: molar volume, electrical conductivity and Martensite start temperature. We make recommendations depending on the nature of the data. We demonstrate that a thorough knowledge of the problem beforehand is critical in selecting the most successful machine learning technique. Our findings show that the Gaussian process regression technique gives very good predictions for all three sets of tested data. Typically, Gaussian process is very slow with a computational complexity of typicallyn3where n is the number of data points. In this paper, we found that the scalable Gaussian process approach was able to maintain the high accuracy of the predictions while improving speed considerably, make on-line learning possible.},

The proposed derivative curve separation method yields data which accords with the experimental results. Besides the new method appears a useful tool whereby it becomes possible to confirm the evidence reported earlier in literature that when a hypoeutectoid steel heats up to between the A1 and the A3 both ferrite and pearlite start to transform into austenite almost at the same time.},

The update adds important information about new processes and process control techniques that have been developed or refined in recent years. Helpfull appendices have been added on decarburization of steels, boost/diffues cycles for carburizing, and process verification.},
