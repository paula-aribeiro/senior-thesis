abstract = {The functions of the National Bureau of Standards are set forth in the Act of Congress, March 3, 1901, as amended by Congress in Public Law 619, 1950. These include the development and maintenance of the national standards of measurement and the provision of means and methods for ittjilciiig measurements consistent with these standards; the determination of physical constants and properties of materials; the development of methods and instruments for testing materials, devices, and structures; advisory services to government agencies on scientific and technical problems; inven tion and development of devices to serve special needs of the Government; and the development of standard practices, codes, and specifications. The work includes basic and applied research, develop ment, engineering, instrumentation, testing, evaluation, calibration services, and various consultation and information services* Research projects are also performed for other government agencies when the work relates to and supplements the basic program of the Bureau or when the Bureau's unicpie competence is required. The scope of activities is suggested by the listing of divisions and sections on the inside of the bade cover* Publications The results of the Bureau's work take the form of either actual equipment and devices or pub lished papers. These papers appear either in the Bureau's own series of publications or in the journals of professional and scientific societies. The Bureau itself publishes three periodicals available from the Government Printing Office: The Journal of Research, published in four separate sections, presents complete scientific and technical papers; the Technical News Bulletin presents summary and preliminary reports on work in progress; and Basic Radio Propagation Predictions provides data for determining the best frequencies to use for radio communications throughout the world* There are also five series of nonperiodical publications: Monographs, Applied Mathematics Series, Handbooks, Miscellaneous Publications, and Technical Notes. Information on the Bureau's publications can be found in NBS Circular 460, Publications of the National Bureau of Standards ({\$}1*25) and its Supplement ({\$}1.50), available from the Super intendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington 25, JXC.},

@book{Dossett2006,
abstract = {What is heat treatment? This book describes heat treating technology in clear, concise, and nontheoretical language. It is an excellent introduction and guide for design and manufacturing engineers, technicians, students, and others who need to understand why heat treatment is specified and how different processes are used to obtain desired properties. The new Second Edition has been extensively updated and revised by Jon. L. Dossett, who has more than forty years of experience in theat treating operations and management. The update adds important information about new processes and process control techniques that have been developed or refined in recent years. Helpfull appendices have been added on decarburization of steels, boost/diffues cycles for carburizing, and process verification.},

@article{Bhadeshia1999,
abstract = {There are difficult problems in materials science where the generai concepts might be understood but which are not as yet amenableto scientific treatment. Weare at the sametime told that good engineering has the responsibility to reach objectives in a cost and time-effective way. Any model which deals with only a smali part of the required technology is therefore unlikely to be treated with respect. Neural network analysis is a form of regression or classification modelling which can help resolve these difficulties whilst striving for longer term solutions. This paper begins with an introduction to neural networks and contains a review of someapp]ications of the technique in the context of materia]s science.},

@article{Belisle2015,
abstract = {A knowledge of the physical properties of materials as a function of temperature, composition, applied external stresses, etc. is an important consideration in materials and process design. For new systems, such properties may be unknown and hard to measure or estimate from numerical simulations such as molecular dynamics. Engineers rely on machine learning to employ existing data in order to predict properties for new systems. Several techniques are currently used for such purposes. These include neural network, polynomial interpolation and Gaussian processes as well as the more recent dynamic trees and scalable Gaussian processes. In this paper we compare these approaches for three sets of materials sciences data: molar volume, electrical conductivity and Martensite start temperature. We make recommendations depending on the nature of the data. We demonstrate that a thorough knowledge of the problem beforehand is critical in selecting the most successful machine learning technique. Our findings show that the Gaussian process regression technique gives very good predictions for all three sets of tested data. Typically, Gaussian process is very slow with a computational complexity of typicallyn3where n is the number of data points. In this paper, we found that the scalable Gaussian process approach was able to maintain the high accuracy of the predictions while improving speed considerably, make on-line learning possible.},
