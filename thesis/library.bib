abstract = {A new approach to predict athermal martensite formation in metals is presented. It is based on computing the driving force of the transformation including a strain energy term induced by atomic shear displacements and energy terms due to substitutional and interstitial lattice distortions. The model is applied to prescribe the martensite and austenite start temperatures in Fe-, Ti- and Co-based alloys with no adjustable parameters. Expressions for Msvariations with composition are derived for multicomponent systems. The transformation temperature hysteresis is predicted in Co alloys showing that this approximation can be used to design alloys with the shape memory effect.},

abstract = {In the paper the method of forecasting of Continuous Cooling Transformation (CCT) diagrams for steels by the use of neural networks has been presented. Input data are chemical composition and austenitising temperature. Results of calculation of neural networks consist of temperature of the beginning and the end of transformation in the function of cooling rate, the participation of the structural components and the hardness of steel cooled from austenitising temperature with a fixed rate. Presented quantities enable to draw the CCT diagram. The model presented in the paper enables the analysis of the influence of the chemical composition and austenitising temperature on CCT diagrams. In order to work out the methods, the set of experimental data worked out on the basis of information available in the literature consisting of 400 CCT diagrams made for constructional and machinable steels were used. {\textcopyright}2004 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Schulze2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.For the modeling and design of heat treatments, in consideration of the development/ transformation of the microstructure, different material data depending on the chemical composition, the respective microstructure/phases and the temperature are necessary. Material data are, e.g. the thermal conductivity, heat capacity, thermal expansion and transformation data etc. The quality of thermal simulations strongly depends on the accuracy of the material data. For many materials, the required data - in particular for different microstructures and temperatures - are rare in the literature. In addition, a different chemical composition within the permitted limits of the considered steel alloy cannot be predicted. A solution for this problem is provided by the calculation of material data using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). In the present study, the start and finish temperatures of the transformation from the bcc lattice to the fcc lattice structure of hypoeutectoid steels are calculated using an Artificial Neural Network. An appropriate database containing different transformation temperatures (austenite formation temperatures) to train the ANN is selected from the literature. In order to find a suitable feedforward network, the network topologies as well as the activation functions of the hidden layers are varied and subsequently evaluated in terms of the prediction accuracy. The transformation temperatures calculated by the ANN exhibit a very good compliance compared to the experimental data. The results show that the prediction performance is even higher compared to classical empirical equations such as Andrews or Brandis. Therefore, it can be assumed that the presented ANN is a convenient tool to distinguish between bcc and fcc phases in hypoeutectoid steels.},

Weare at the sametime told that good engineering has the responsibility to reach objectives in a cost and time-effective way. Any model which deals with only a smali part of the required technology is therefore unlikely to be treated with respect.

The individual and combined influences of the composition and temperature on $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases were simulated through performing sensitivity analysis. A new method has been proposed to estimate the relative importance of the inputs on the outputs for single phase $\alpha$-Ti, near-$\alpha$ Ti, and $\alpha$ + $\beta$ Ti alloys. The average error of the model predictions for 35 unseen test data sets is 1.546{\%}.

abstract = {A knowledge of the physical properties of materials as a function of temperature, composition, applied external stresses, etc. is an important consideration in materials and process design. For new systems, such properties may be unknown and hard to measure or estimate from numerical simulations such as molecular dynamics. Engineers rely on machine learning to employ existing data in order to predict properties for new systems. Several techniques are currently used for such purposes. These include neural network, polynomial interpolation and Gaussian processes as well as the more recent dynamic trees and scalable Gaussian processes. In this paper we compare these approaches for three sets of materials sciences data: molar volume, electrical conductivity and Martensite start temperature. We make recommendations depending on the nature of the data. We demonstrate that a thorough knowledge of the problem beforehand is critical in selecting the most successful machine learning technique. Our findings show that the Gaussian process regression technique gives very good predictions for all three sets of tested data. Typically, Gaussian process is very slow with a computational complexity of typicallyn3where n is the number of data points. In this paper, we found that the scalable Gaussian process approach was able to maintain the high accuracy of the predictions while improving speed considerably, make on-line learning possible.},
